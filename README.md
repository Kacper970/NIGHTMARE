# NIGHTMARE

## This is my graduation thesis in which I develop the model **NIGHTMARE** for generating comic book representations.

In the folder **train_and_evaluate** all the necessary code to train and evaluate models can be found.

In the folder **inference_data** all the necessary code to generate the data files can be found.

The checkpoints and already generated data files can be downloaded from a google drive:

The thesis pdf can be read for better understanding, it is the pdf with the following name:\ **Master_Thesis_AI_Kacper_Bartosik_12624268.pdf** (TO BE ADDED)

\
\
The foundation of this code is based on the work from the thesis of **Sam Titarsolej**. \
The original implementation can be found at https://github.com/samtitar/ASTERX.
